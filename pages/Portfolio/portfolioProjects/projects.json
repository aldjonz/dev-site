They wanted a site to showcase their music, sell merchandise, show upcoming tour dates and add fans to their mailing list. We decided to use WordPress to build the site as it is a cost effective and quick way to build a site with e-commerce capabilities that looks modern and responsive. The site uses the WooCommerce plugin to handle the e-commerce section and also features Stripe Integration. To build the site I used the popular Elementor plugin but styled most sections with custom CSS.",

The app aims to make businesses' and organisations’ carbon emissions data visible, understandable and available for everyone so that they can find inspiration from one another to reduce their impact on the planet. The beta version of the project is to be released before the end of 2021. In order to make the data understandable we opted to use OpenStreetMap, a user can select or search for a business/organisation through the web app and view it’s emissions data within a selected date range along with the entity’s actions/steps they are taking to reduce their impact on the planet. I work primarily on the front-end of the app alongside other developers to make the app user-friendly and the emissions data more accessible. The project is built using the Ionic framework so that in future it may be made into an app with ease. The back-end is built using Python and Django to manage the data and user login state.",

Users can view walks nearby through the map or the list of walks provided and are guided around the area via the app with audio, text and images to explain the history and relevance of each POI. The project was a rebuild of an already existing version of the app to update it to better handle the larger amount of data it uses. I used React-Native for the rebuild to save time and money for the client because not only does it require half the amount of code but Expo makes testing and building much easier. This project also gave me a good understanding of the popular package react-native-maps as it handles thousand of markers at any one time whilst still maintaining a high level of performance.",
